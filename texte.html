    <h1>Titanic (1997) - full transcript</h1>
    <p class="plot">84 years later, a 100 year-old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story to her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert, Brock Lovett, Lewis Bodine, Bobby Buell and Anatoly Mikailavich on the Keldysh about her life set in April 10th 1912, on a ship called Titanic when young Rose boards the departing ship with the upper-class passengers and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, and her fiancé, Caledon Hockley. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning.</p>

There's still<br/>plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.<br/><br/>The floor debris in the suite,<br/>the mother's room...<br/><br/>the purser's safe on C deck.<br/><br/>Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.<br/><br/>A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just<br/>going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close.<br/><br/>We've just got to go through a little<br/>process of elimination.<br/><br/>Hang on a second.<br/><br/>- Let me see that.<br/>- Ah, we may have something here, guys.<br/><br/>Where's the photograph<br/>of the necklace?<br/><br/>We'll call you right back.<br/><br/>I'll be goddamned.<br/><br/>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett<br/>is best known for finding Spanish gold...<br/><br/>It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.<br/><br/>Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach<br/>the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.<br/><br/>He is with us live via satellite<br/>from the research ship Keldysh...<br/><br/>...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock.<br/><br/>Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows<br/>the familiar stories of Titanic.<br/><br/>You know, the nobility of the<br/>band playing to the very end and all that.<br/><br/>But what I'm interested in are the untold 
    stories.<br/>The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.<br/><br/>And we're out here using robot<br/>technology to go further into the wreck...<br/><br/>...than anybody has ever done before.<br/><br/>Your expedition 
    is at the center<br/>of a storm of controversy...<br/><br/>...over salvage rights and even ethics.<br/>Many are calling you a graverobber.<br/><br/>Well, nobody ever called the<br/>recovery of the artifacts...<br/><br/>What 
    is it?<br/><br/>Turn that up, dear.<br/><br/>I have museum-trained experts<br/>sent out here making sure...<br/><br/>---that these relics are preserved<br/>and catalogued properly.<br/><br/>Take a look at this drawing<br/>that we found just today.<br/><br/>A piece of paper that's been underwater<br/>for 84 years.<br/><br/>And my team are able to<br/>preserve it intact.<br/><br/>Should this have remained unseen<br/>at the bottom of the ocean for eternity...<br/><br/>...when we can see and enjoy it now?<br/><br/>I'll be goddamned.<br/><br/>Brock!<br/><br/>There's a satellite call for you.<br/><br/>Bobby, we're launching. You see<br/>these submersibles going in the water?<br/><br/>Trust me, buddy.<br/>You want to take this call.<br/><br/>This better be good.<br/><br/>Now, you gotta speak up.<br/>She's kind of old.<br/><br/>Great.<br/><br/>This is Brock Lovett.<br/>How can I help you, Mrs...?<br/><br/>Calvert. Rose Calvert.<br/><br/>Mrs. Calvert.<br/><br/>I was just wondering if you had found...<br/><br/>...the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.<br/><br/>Told you you wanted to take the call.<br/><br/>All right, you have my<br/>attention, Rose.<br/><br/>Can you tell us who the woman<br/>in the picture is?<br/><br/>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.<br/><br/>She's a goddamn liar!<br/>Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.<br/><br/>God only knows why.<br/>Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.<br/><br/>They're inbound!<br/><br/>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the<br/>Titanic when she was 17, right?<br/><br/>- That's right.<br/>- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.<br/><br/>101 next month.<br/><br/>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.<br/><br/>Look, I've already done the<br/>background on this woman...<br/><br/>...all the way back to the 20s,<br/>when she was working as an actress.<br/><br/>An actress.<br/>There's your first clue, Sherlock.<br/><br/>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.<br/>Then she marries this guy named Calvert.<br/><br/>They move to Cedar Rapids<br/>and she punches out a couple of kids.<br/><br/>Now Calvert's dead<br/>and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.<br/><br/>And everybody who knows about the<br/>diamond is supposed to be dead...<br/><br/>...or on this boat,<br/>but she knows.<br/><br/>Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?<br/><br/>Hurry up, give him a hand.<br/><br/>Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.<br/>Welcome to the Keldysh.<br/><br/>Okay, let's get her inside there.<br/><br/>Hi, Miss Calvert.<br/><br/>- Hi.<br/>- Welcome to the Keldysh.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Hey!<br/><br/>Are your staterooms<br/>all right?<br/><br/>Oh, yes.<br/><br/>Very nice.<br/><br/>Have you met my<br/>granddaughter, Lizzy?<br/><br/>She takes care of me.<br/><br/>We met just a few<br/>minutes ago.<br/><br/>Remember, Nana?<br/>Up on deck?<br/><br/>Oh, yes.<br/><br/>There. That's nice.<br/><br/>Have to have my<br/>pictures when I travel.<br/><br/>Can I get you anything?<br/><br/>Is there anything you'd like?<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>I would like to<br/>see my drawing.<br/><br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous<br/>stone that was...<br/><br/>...called the Blue Diamond<br/>of the Crown...<br/><br/>...which disappeared<br/>in 1792...<br/><br/>...about the same time old Louis lost<br/>everything from the neck up.<br/><br/>The theory goes that the<br/>crown diamond was chopped, too.<br/><br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that<br/>became known as...<br/><br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.<br/><br/>Today it would be worth<br/>more than the Hope diamond.<br/><br/>It was a dreadful,<br/>heavy thing.<br/><br/>I only wore it this once.<br/><br/>You actually think<br/>this is you, Nana?<br/><br/>It is me, dear.<br/><br/>Wasn't I a dish?<br/><br/>I tracked it down<br/>through insurance records.<br/><br/>An old claim that was settled<br/>under terms of absolute secrecy.<br/><br/>Can you tell me who the<br/>claimant was, Rose?<br/><br/>I should imagine someone<br/>named Hockley.<br/><br/>Nathan Hockley,<br/>that's right.<br/><br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.<br/><br/>The claim was for a<br/>diamond necklace his son...<br/><br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.<br/><br/>You.<br/><br/>A week before he<br/>sailed on Titanic.<br/><br/>And it was filed right<br/>after the sinking.<br/><br/>So the diamond 
    had to have<br/>gone down with the ship.<br/><br/>You see the date?<br/><br/>April 14, 1912<br/><br/>Which means if your grandmother<br/>is who she says she is...<br/><br/>...she was wearing the diamond<br/>the day the Titanic sank.<br/><br/>And that makes you<br/>my new best friend.<br/><br/>These are some of the things<br/>we recovered from your stateroom.<br/><br/>This was mine.<br/><br/>How extraordinary.<br/><br/>And it looks the same as it<br/>did the last time I saw it.<br/><br/>The reflection has<br/>changed a bit.<br/><br/>Are you ready to go<br/>back to Titanic?<br/><br/>Okay, here we go.<br/><br/>She hits the berg on<br/>the starboard side, right?<br/><br/>She kind of bumps along...<br/><br/>...punching holes like<br/>morse code...<br/><br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...<br/><br/>...below the waterline.<br/><br/>Then the forward compartments<br/>start to flood.<br/><br/>Now, as the water<br/>level rises...<br/><br/>...it spills over the<br/>watertight bulkheads...<br/><br/>which, unfortunately, don't go<br/>any higher than E deck-<br/><br/>So now as the<br/>bow goes down...<br/><br/>...the stern rises up,<br/>slow at first...<br/><br/>...then faster and faster...<br/><br/>...until finally, she's got her whole<br/>ass sticking up in the air.<br/><br/>And that's a big ass.<br/><br/>We're talking<br/>20, 30,000 tons. Okay?<br/><br/>And the hull's not designed<br/>to deal with that pressure.<br/><br/>So, what happens?<br/><br/>She splits, right<br/>down to the keel.<br/><br/>And the stern...<br/><br/>...falls back level.<br/><br/>Then...<br/><br/>...as the bow sinks...<br/><br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...<br/><br/>...and then finally detaches.<br/><br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs<br/>there like a cork for a couple of minutes...<br/><br/>...floods, and finally goes<br/>under about 2:20 AM...<br/><br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes<br/>after the collision.<br/><br/>The bow section<br/>planes away...<br/><br/>...landing about a<br/>half a mile away...<br/><br/>...going 20, 30 knots when<br/>it hits the ocean floor.<br/><br/>Pretty cool, huh?<br/><br/>Thank you for that fine<br/>forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.<br/><br/>Of course, the<br/>experience of it was...<br/><br/>...somewhat different.<br/><br/>Will you share it with us?<br/><br/>I'm taking her to rest.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Come on, Nana.<br/><br/>No!<br/><br/>Give me the<br/>tape recorder.<br/><br/>Tell us, Rose.<br/><br/>It's been 84 years--<br/><br/>It's okay. Just try<br/>to remember anything...<br/><br/>...anything at all.<br/><br/>Do you want to hear this<br/>or not, Mr. Lovett?<br/><br/>It's been 84 years...<br/><br/>...and I can still smell<br/>the fresh 
    paint.<br/><br/>The china had<br/>never been used.<br/><br/>The sheets had<br/>never been slept in.<br/><br/>Titanic was called<br/>the ship of dreams.<br/><br/>And it was.<br/><br/>It really was.<br/><br/>All third-class<br/>passengers...<br/><br/>...with a forward berth...<br/><br/>...this way please!<br/>This queue!<br/><br/>It's a big boat, huh?<br/><br/>Daddy, it's a ship.<br/><br/>You're right.<br/><br/>I don't see what all<br/>the fuss is about.<br/><br/>It doesn't look any bigger<br/>than the Mauretania.<br/><br/>You can be blasé<br/>about some things, Rose...<br/><br/>...but not about Titanic.<br/><br/>It's over 100 feet longer<br/>than Mauretania...<br/><br/>...and far more luxurious.<br/><br/>Your daughter is far too<br/>difficult to impress, Ruth.<br/><br/>So this is the ship they<br/>say is unsinkable.<br/><br/>It is unsinkable.<br/><br/>God Himself<br/>could not sink this ship--<br/><br/>Wh at?!<br/><br/>You have to check your baggage<br/>through the main terminal.<br/><br/>It's round that<br/>way, sir.<br/><br/>I put my faith in<br/>you good sir.<br/><br/>Now kindly<br/>see my man.<br/><br/>Yes sir.

    water being so cold.<br/><br/>How cold?<br/><br/>Freezing.<br/>Maybe a couple degrees over.<br/><br/>You ever, uh...<br/><br/>...ever been<br/>to Wisconsin?<br/><br/>Wh at?<br/><br/>Well, they have some of<br/>the coldest winters around.<br/><br/>I grew up there,<br/>near Chippewa Falls.<br/><br/>I remember when I was a kid,<br/>me and my father, we went ice fishing...<br/><br/>...out on Lake Wissota.<br/><br/>Ice fishing is, you know, where you--<br/><br/>I know what ice fishing is!<br/><br/>Sorry.<br/><br/>You just seem like, you know,<br/>kind of an indoor girl.<br/><br/>Anyway, I...<br/><br/>...fell through some thin ice.<br/><br/>And I'm telling you...<br/><br/>...water that cold,<br/><br/>like right down there...<br/><br/>...it hits you like 1000 knives<br/>stabbing you all over your body.<br/><br/>You can't breathe.<br/><br/>You can't think. Least not about<br/>anything but the pain.<br/><br/>Which is why I'm not looking<br/>forward to jumping in there after you.<br/><br/>Like I said...<br/><br/>...I don't have a choice.<br/><br/>I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll<br/>come back over the rail and...<br/><br/>...and get me off<br/>the hook here.<br/><br/>You're crazy.<br/><br/>That's what everybody says but...<br/><br/>...with all due respect, miss...<br/><br/>...I'm not the one hanging off<br/>the back of a ship here.<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/>Come on, give me your hand.<br/><br/>You don't want to do this.<br/><br/>I'm Jack Dawson.<br/><br/>Rose DeWitt Bu kater.<br/><br/>I'll have to get you to<br/>write that one down.<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/>I got you.<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/>Help, please!<br/><br/>Help!<br/><br/>- Please, help me!<br/>- Listen. Listen to me.<br/><br/>Listen. Listen to me.<br/><br/>I've got you.<br/>I won't let go.<br/><br/>Now pull yourself up.<br/>Come on!<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/>That's right.<br/><br/>You can do it.<br/><br/>I got you.<br/><br/>What's all this?<br/><br/>You stand back and...<br/><br/>...don't move an inch!<br/><br/>Fetch the Master at Arms.<br/><br/>This is completely unacceptable!<br/><br/>What made you think that you could<br/>put your hands on my fiancée?!<br/><br/>Look at me, you filth!<br/><br/>Cal.<br/><br/>What do you think<br/>you were doing?<br/><br/>Cal, stop.<br/>It was an accident.<br/><br/>An accident?<br/><br/>It was.<br/><br/>Stupid, really.<br/><br/>I was leaning over and I slipped.<br/><br/>I was leaning far over<br/>to see the, uh...<br/><br/>...uh, uh, the uh...<br/><br/>- Propellers?<br/>- Propellers, and I slipped.<br/><br/>And I would have gone<br/>overboard but Mr. Dawson here...<br/><br/>...saved me. And almost<br/>went over himself.<br/><br/>You 
    wanted to see the...<br/>She wanted to see the propellers.<br/><br/>Like I said, women and<br/>machinery do not mix.<br/><br/>Was that the way of it?<br/><br/>Yeah. Yeah, that<br/>was pretty much it.<br/><br/>Well, the boy's a hero then.<br/><br/>Good for you, son.<br/>Well done.<br/><br/>So, it's all's well and back<br/>to our brandy, eh?<br/><br/>Look at you. You must be freezing.<br/>Let's get you inside.<br/><br/>Perhaps a little something<br/>for the boy?<br/><br/>Of course.<br/><br/>Mr. Lovejoy,<br/>I think a 20 should do it.<br/><br/>Is that the going rate<br/>for saving the woman you love?<br/><br/>Rose is displeased.<br/><br/>What to do?<br/><br/>I know.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could join us for<br/>dinner tomorrow evening...<br/><br/>...to regale our group...<br/><br/>...with your heroic tale.<br/><br/>Sure.<br/>Count me in.<br/><br/>Good.<br/>It's settled then.<br/><br/>This 
    should be interesting.<br/><br/>Can I bum a smoke?<br/><br/>You'll want to tie those.<br/><br/>It's interesting...<br/><br/>...the young lady slipped<br/>so suddenly...<br/><br/>...and you still had time to remove<br/>your jacket and your shoes.<br/><br/>I know you've been melancholy.<br/><br/>I don't pretend to know why.<br/><br/>I intended to save this...<br/><br/>...until the engagement<br/>gala next week...<br/><br/>...but, I thought...<br/><br/>...tonight.<br/><br/>Good gracious.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a reminder<br/>of my feelings for you.<br/><br/>- Is it a--<br/>- Diamond. Yes.<br/><br/>56 carats to be exact.<br/><br/>It was worn by Louis XVI.<br/><br/>And they called<br/>it Le Coeur de Ia Mer.<br/><br/>- The Heart of the Ocean.<br/>- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.<br/><br/>It's overwhelming.<br/><br/>Well, it's for royalty.<br/><br/>We are royalty, Rose.<br/><br/>You know, there's<br/>nothing I couldn't give you.<br/><br/>There's nothing I'd deny you...<br/><br/>...if you would not deny me.<br/><br/>Open your heart to me, Rose.<br/><br/>Well, I've been on my own since<br/>I was 15, since my folks died.<br/><br/>And I had no brothers or sisters or<br/>close kin in that part of the country...<br/><br/>...so I lit on out of there and I<br/>haven't been back since.<br/><br/>You could just call me a<br/>tumbleweed blowing in the wind.<br/><br/>Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile<br/>around this boat deck and...<br/><br/>...chewed over how great the weather's<br/>been and how I grew up...<br/><br/>...but I reckon that's not why<br/>you came to talk to me, is it?<br/><br/>- Mr. Dawson, I--<br/>- Jack.<br/><br/>Jack.<br/><br/>I want to thank you<br/>for what you did.<br/><br/>Not just for pulling me back,<br/>but for your discretion.<br/><br/>You're welcome.<br/><br/>Look.<br/><br/>I know what you<br/>must be thinking.<br/><br/>Poor little rich girl.<br/><br/>What does she know about misery?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>No, that's not what I was thinking.<br/><br/>What I was thinking was...<br/><br/>---what could have happened to this girl<br/>to make her think she had no way out?<br/><br/>Well I...<br/><br/>It was everything.<br/>It was my whole world and...<br/><br/>...all the people in it.<br/><br/>And the 
    inertia of my life,<br/>plunging ahead and me...<br/><br/>...powerless to stop it.<br/><br/>God,<br/>look at that thing.<br/><br/>You would have gone<br/>straight to the bottom.<br/><br/>500 invitations have gone out.<br/><br/>All of Philadelphia society will be there.<br/><br/>And all the while I feel I'm...<br/><br/>...standing in the middle<br/>of a crowded room...<br/><br/>...screaming at the<br/>top of my lungs...<br/><br/>...and no one<br/>even looks up.<br/><br/>Do you love him?<br/><br/>Pardon me?<br/><br/>Do you love him?<br/><br/>You're being very rude. You<br/>shouldn't be asking me this.<br/><br/>Well, it's a simple question.<br/>Do you love the guy or not?<br/><br/>This is not a suitable conversation.<br/><br/>VVhy can't you just<br/>answer the question?<br/><br/>This is absurd.<br/><br/>You don't know me<br/>and I don't know you...<br/><br/>...and we are not having this<br/>conversation at all. You are rude...<br/><br/>...and uncouth and presumptuous<br/>and I am leaving now...<br/><br/>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.<br/>It's been a pleasure.<br/><br/>I sought you out to thank you<br/>and now I have thanked you.<br/><br/>And you've insulted me.<br/><br/>Well, you deserved it.<br/><br/>- Right.<br/>- Right.<br/><br/>I thought you were leaving.<br/><br/>I am.<br/><br/>You are so annoying.<br/><br/>Wait.<br/><br/>I don't 
    have to leave. This is<br/>my part of the ship. You leave.<br/><br/>Well, well, well.<br/>Now who's being rude?<br/><br/>What is this stupid thing<br/>you're carrying around?<br/><br/>So, what are you,<br/>an artist or something?<br/><br/>These are rather good.<br/><br/>They're very good, actually.<br/><br/>Jack, this is exquisite work.<br/><br/>Ah, they didn't think too<br/>much of them in old Paree.<br/><br/>Paris?<br/><br/>You do get around<br/>for a p--<br/><br/>Well, a-- a<br/>person of limited means.<br/><br/>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.<br/><br/>Well, well, well.<br/><br/>And these were drawn from life?<br/><br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.<br/><br/>Lots of girls are willing<br/>to take their clothes off.<br/><br/>You liked this woman.<br/><br/>You used her several times.<br/><br/>Well.<br/><br/>She had beautiful<br/>hands, you see?<br/><br/>I think you must have<br/>had a love affair with her.<br/><br/>No, no, no.<br/>Just with her hands.<br/><br/>She was a<br/>one-legged prostitute.<br/><br/>See?<br/><br/>She had a good<br/>sense of humor though.<br/><br/>Oh, and this 
    lady...<br/><br/>She used to sit at this bar every night...<br/><br/>...wearing every piece<br/>of jewelry she owned...<br/><br/>...just waiting for<br/>her long, lost love.<br/><br/>We called her Madame Bijoux.<br/><br/>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.<br/><br/>Well,<br/>you have a gift, Jack.<br/><br/>You do.<br/><br/>You see people.<br/><br/>I see you.<br/><br/>And?<br/><br/>You wouldn't have jumped.<br/><br/>But the purpose of university<br/>is to find a suitable husband.<br/><br/>Rose has already done that.<br/><br/>Look, here comes that<br/>vulgar Brown woman.<br/><br/>Quickly, get up before<br/>she sits with us.<br/><br/>Hello, girls. I was hoping<br/>I'd catch you at tea.<br/><br/>We're awfully sorry,<br/>you missed it.<br/><br/>The Countess and I were just<br/>off to take the air on the boat deck.<br/><br/>What a lovely idea.<br/>I need to catch up on my gossip.<br/><br/>Countess.<br/><br/>So, you've not yet lit the<br/>last four boilers?<br/><br/>No, I don't see<br/>the need.<br/><br/>We are making excellent time.<br/><br/>The press knows the size of Titanic.<br/>Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.<br/><br/>We must give them<br/>something new to print.<br/><br/>This maiden voyage<br/>of Titanic must...<br/><br/>...make headlines.<br/><br/>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer<br/>not to push the engines...<br/><br/>...until they've been properly run in.<br/><br/>Of course I'm just a passenger.<br/><br/>I leave it to your good offices<br/>to decide what's best.<br/><br/>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...<br/><br/>...if we were to get into New York<br/>on Tuesday night...<br/><br/>...and surprise them all.<br/>Make the morning papers.<br/><br/>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?<br/><br/>Good man.<br/><br/>After that, I worked<br/>on a squid boat in Monterey...<br/><br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...<br/><br/>...Santa Monica pier<br/>and did portraits for 10 cents each.<br/><br/>Why can't I be like you?<br/><br/>Just head out for the horizon<br/>whenever I feel like it.<br/><br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...<br/><br/>only if we just talk about it<br/><br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.<br/><br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up<br/><br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.<br/><br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.<br/>No sidesaddle stuff.<br/><br/>You mean with one leg on each side?<br/><br/>Can you show me?<br/><br/>Sure, if you like.<br/><br/>Teach me to ride like a man.<br/><br/>Chew tobacco like a man.<br/><br/>And spit like a man.<br/><br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Come on, I'll show you.<br/><br/>I'll show you how.<br/><br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.<br/><br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.<br/><br/>Watch closely.<br/><br/>That's disgusting.<br/><br/>Your turn<br/><br/>That was pitiful.<br/>You really have to hawk it back.<br/><br/>Get some leverage.<br/>Use your arms. Arc your neck.<br/><br/>You see the range on that thing?<br/><br/>Okay, go.<br/><br/>That was better. You have to work on it.<br/>Really try to hawk it up.<br/><br/>Mother.<br/><br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?<br/><br/>Charmed, I'm sure.<br/><br/>The others were gracious and curious<br/>about the man who'd saved my life.<br/><br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.<br/><br/>A dangerous insect<br/>which must be squashed quickly.<br/><br/>Sounds like you're a good man<br/>to have around in a sticky spot.<br/><br/>Why do they always insist on announcing<br/>dinner like a damn cavalry charge?<br/><br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?<br/><br/>See you at dinner, Jack.<br/><br/>Uh, son?<br/><br/>Son!<br/><br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?<br/><br/>Not really.<br/><br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.<br/><br/>What are you going to wear?<br/><br/>I figured. Come on.<br/><br/>I was right. You and my son<br/>are just about the same size.<br/><br/>Pretty close.<br/><br/>You shine up like a new penny.<br/><br/>Good evening, sir.<br/><br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel<br/>are in this ship.<br/><br/>- Which part?<br/>- All the right ones.<br/><br/>Then you're accountable<br/>if there's a problem. Where's Rose?<br/><br/>She'll be along.<br/><br/>There is the Countess.<br/><br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon<br/>and always wanted to do it.<br/><br/>Darling...<br/><br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.<br/><br/>It's amazing.<br/>You could almost pass for a gentleman.<br/><br/>Almost.<br/><br/>This is extraordinary.<br/><br/>This is a remarkable voyage.<br/><br/>- Mad.<br/>- Completely lunatic.<br/><br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.<br/><br/>That's John Jacob Astor...<br/><br/>...the richest man on board.<br/><br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,<br/>is my age and in a delicate condition.<br/><br/>See how she tries to hide it.<br/><br/>Quite the scandal.<br/><br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,<br/>Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...<br/><br/>...is at home with the children, of course.<br/>And over here...<br/><br/>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.<br/><br/>She designs naughty lingerie,<br/>among her many talents.<br/><br/>Very popular with the royals.<br/><br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.<br/><br/>Why, thank you.<br/><br/>Escort a lady to dinner?<br/><br/>Certainly.<br/><br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.<br/><br/>Ain't nothing to it.<br/><br/>They love money.
